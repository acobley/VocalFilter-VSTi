"""Guard one editor invariant that no runtime test can reach.

`CControl::setValue` assigns the value and nothing else - it does NOT mark
the view dirty. A control whose displayed value is set without an
accompanying `invalid()` therefore repaints only when something else happens
to dirty the same region, which reads as "it works sometimes".

That is not hypothetical: the Voice switch shipped that way. It was correct
under the mouse, because SpyToggle's own handler invalidates, and
intermittent under host automation, because the update path did not.

So: `setValueNormalized` may appear in VocalFilterEditor.cpp exactly once,
inside `showValue`, which pairs it with `invalid()`.

    python3 tools/check-editor.py        # exits 1 and names the line on failure

WHAT THIS DOES NOT DO: it cannot tell you that showValue is CALLED where it
should be, only that nothing bypasses it. It is a guard against reintroducing
a known mistake, not a proof of correctness.
